      I got into event management because it became my escape from everyday
      life. The endless possibilities of what I could help create always brought
      about excitement. I have received my professional certificate in event
      management at Arthur Lok Jack Global School of Business. This course is in
      collaboration with George Washington University and is taught by quite a
      few of our own local event professionals.

      I have been doing events since my early teens, first alongside my mom,
      helping with school events, bridal showers, concerts, and the list goes
      on. But it was helping plan a wedding that showed me a gap in the market,
      giving me the idea to start Every Little Detail Events. I wanted to create
      a business that could fit multiple needs, be affordable and different. I
      can honestly go on and on, but I’ll stop here, I can’t wait to help you
      make lasting memories at your dream events.

     My position in the company is an event manager and social media operator.
      I graduated having completed my level 4 diploma in event management at
      Trinidad and Tobago Business Etiquette and Protocol Specialists Limited. I
      gained experience from volunteering opportunities with Mr. Steven Jones
      national director at “Miss Supranational Trinidad and Tobago”, also a
      lecturer at the institution. </p>

      <p>Events weren’t always my first option however
      there was one volunteer opportunity that ignited a spark in me. Being able
      to witness the execution of an official miss supranational pageant, from
      set up to break down was an amazing experience. Apart from my newfound
      love for events, I am continuously developing my social media marketing
      skill in hopes of one day making this company your go to event company.
